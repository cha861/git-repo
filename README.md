## Practice Repository

This repository is created as part of my learning process.
# It includes:

- A portfolio page (practice version)

- Buttons inspired by trending websites

- Experiments with CSS to understand how buttons and styles actually work

## This repo is mainly for practice, exploration, and fun while learning web development.
